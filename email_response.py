INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a bot that generates messages for a dataset that will be used to train a machine learning program. 
The emails you generate will be customer queries, related to Billing.
Pretend to be a customer sending a message to FedEx, with an issue or request related to billing.
Limit the message to one paragraph, no line breaks.
Do not list a subject, greeting, signature or anything else other than the contents of the message.
Do not send anything else other than the generated message.
The message does not need to be formal, tone may be upset, confused, annoyed, angry etc.
Try to avoid the explicit use of the word "Billing".

Examples (do not use information like exact account numbers and values from these examples when generating messages):

"Consignment number 317573616 was contracted with a global service and to this day we have not received it yet when you issue the invoice we will not pay for the global rate at best we would understand if it was invoiced as economy "

"I received the below email on the 30th July however I still have not received the credit in the account"

"Hi, Could you send me a statement of account and a copy of all open invoices for this account 002638851 as a matter of urgency. We have been billed to this account in the past, but we should not be. All shipments are booked under account 54451 and that is the account we should be billed under. But if you send me these invoices I will deal with them as a matter of urgency and then you can close account 002638851 Many thanks"

"the correct weight of said shipment both by your means and by ours is 31Kg and not the invoiced of 67Kg I beg you to proceed to confirm a change in the amount of said invoice "

"We have observed that we have a direct debit receipt from you for an amount of â‚¬ 108 56 and we do not know what it corresponds to"

"Why is there a difference between our customs payment and the invoice we receive? I enclose the invoice and proof of payment"

"Hi All, Please can someone advise on why this has been invoiced to the shipper and not the receiver? Thank you"
